# ClassicalField Module Documentation

## Overview
The `ClassicalField` class is responsible for converting quantum probability expectations into a classical field representation.

## `ClassicalField` Class
- `__init__(self, probability_expectation)`: Constructor that initializes the `ClassicalField` with a given probability expectation.
- `to_classical(self)`: Method that converts the quantum probability expectation to a classical field. This method should be updated with the actual conversion logic.
