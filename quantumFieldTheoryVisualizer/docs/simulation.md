# Simulation Module Documentation

## Overview
The `Simulation` class orchestrates the creation of quantum fields, psi functions, probability expectations, and classical fields, and then visualizes the results.

## `Simulation` Class
- `__init__(self, visualizer)`: Constructor that initializes the `Simulation` with a visualizer.
- `run_simulation(self, parameters)`: Method that runs the simulation process, including the creation of quantum fields, psi functions, probability expectations, and classical fields, and visualizes the results.
