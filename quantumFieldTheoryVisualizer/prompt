You previously made software based on the below:

--------------------------------------------------------

In reality, physics indicates that most of what we see is based on quantum fields.
Every elementary particle has a quantum field, and their interactiosn
when integrated create the quantum mechanical psi function and then the integration of that via probability expectations creates
the nearly semi-classical gravity version of GR that predicts reality.


I want to build a visual software that will allow someone to
explore this and create visual representations that show how
the EM quantum field can build up to a radio wave that is used by
humans on the classical large scale.

Can you create a well made python based visualizer based on the
instructions above with highly tunable parameters for users?

Thank you!

Can you pelase create a design document and a bunch of summaries of the work you did so engieners can know how to start adding to the codebase? And add as much dcumentationa s you think necessary for your components, maybe in it's own directory.
